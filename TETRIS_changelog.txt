> CHANGELOG: (order: from later to older)
	> v2.A.2 (09052016)
		+ ADD:  ModelInfoGetter: more to be added.
				ModelListener: only place holder atm.

	> v2.A.1 (02052016)
		! INFO: Imported to IntelIJ for later improvements.
		# FIX:	Minor redundant booleans. 
					* Example » BEFORE: exit==true, NOW: exit

	> v1.2 	 (22012015)
		! INFO: Score per line no longer has a fixed variable.
				Now dependent from: Score.SCORE_MINIBLOCK and Board.DIM_COLS.
				Equation now is: "Score.scoreCalc(DIM_COLS*Score.SCORE_MINIBLOCK)"

	> v1.1.1 (19012015)
		# FIX:  Incorrect collision detection on new piece.
				Collision box size was: 4x3 (increased to 4x4).
		# FIX:  Next Piece was updating when "Game Over" occurred. 
	
	> v1.1 	 (19012015)
		# FIX:	Line counter, not counting lines. (bug was introduced after the rework)

	> v1.0 	 (17012015)
		! INFO: Initial Release.
		+ ADD:  New comments for better interpretation.
		- REM:  Redundant code when drawing pieces
		# FIX:  Incorrect score calculation when deleting lines.
		# FIX:  Faster Pieces counters, only updates the counter for 1 type per turn.

	> RC 1.2
		- REM:	Redundant code while displaying Piece on Board.
		# FIX:	Improved algorithm when saving Piece, no longer "writes" the Piece on
				the Board, instead only saves it. To "write" it, call draw(...).
		! INFO:	gameOver moved from "main" to "clearNewGame".
		# FIX:	Now adding additional text to the KEYMAP_TXT, adds 1 more line at the
				bottom. This way KEYMAP_TXT never touches the bottom of the window.
		# FIX:	Small changes, specially method names.
		# FIX:	Bugs introduced after the new saving algorithm:
				* Score not counting Lines.
				* Incorrect time while "PAUSE".
		- Removed White Piece.
	
	> RC 1.1
		- REM:	Array boardCopy deprecated, new algorithm can copy the above line and
				move it down.
		# FIX:	Effects adjusted according to new way of handling with moving lines.
				(arrays: 1)
		- REM:	Redundant code when deleting and moving lines.
		- Removed White Piece.
	
	> RC 1.0
		+ ADD:	Customizable Piece counter position.
		+ ADD:	More constants for personalisation:
				BOARD:
					* WAIT » waiting time in milliseconds to delete next line.
				SCORE:
					* SCORE_SHOW   » if true will draw the Score in-game.
					* KEYMAP_SHOW  » if true will draw the KeyMap in-game.
					* CR_FOREG_XXX » changes the color of the foreground for "XXX".
					* CR_BACKG_XXX » changes the color of the background for "XXX".
					* H_POS_X and V_POS_X » changes piece counter position.
					* MUSIC » write the name of the song that you want to be heard
							  in-game without the extension (music in .wav).
							  Music file goes to sound folder.
					* MUSIC_STATE  » if true will start playing the music when game
									 starts.
		- REM:	Array lineCheck deprecated, new algorithm can check if line is full.
		- Removed White Piece

		# FIX:	Changing board size and/or board starting position no longer crashes.
		+ ADD:	Score now works.
		+ ADD:	Constants for score and line multiplier, next level in 'X' Pieces.
